## Key Summary

| Item | Without MCP | With MCP |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Basis for answers | Guesses / general knowledge | Actual code analysis |
| Token count | Not comparable | Cannot be fairly compared (see note) |
| Accuracy | ❌ Unverifiable / hallucinations | ✅ Code-based facts |
| Hallucination | High | None |

> **Why token count is not comparable:**
> When using MCP, a single user question may trigger multiple tool calls, each returning
> structured analysis data. The AI also re-reads conversation history on every turn.
> Without MCP, the AI may read raw source files wholesale, overflow the context window,
> or guess without reading anything at all. These are fundamentally different workflows —
> comparing token counts between them is like comparing fuel consumption between
> a car and a boat: the numbers exist, but the comparison has no actionable meaning.
>
> **What the numbers actually tell you:**
> Use MCP and get a precise, code-backed answer in one shot.
> Skip MCP and you get guesses, hallucinations, or a bloated context from reading
> the wrong files. The accuracy gap (0/5 vs 5/5) is what matters, not the token count.

## Detailed Results

### Q1 — "What does CombatManager do, and which classes depend on it?"

| | Method A (no MCP) | Method B (with MCP) |
|--|--|--|
| **Tool** | None | `explore_class_semantics` |

**Method A answer:**
> "CombatManager is probably a battle-related manager class based on its name.  
> UI or data classes are likely to reference it.  
> The exact list of dependent classes is unknown."

**Method B answer (MCP):**
> CombatManager extends `ManagerBase`. Fields: 173 / Methods: 283 / External refs: 104 — a **God Object**.  
> Key dependents: CombatCore, UIGameField, UIHandDisplay, EntityCard, RuntimeAbility and more.  
> Directly referenced only by the `Managers` singleton, but used project-wide as `Managers.Battle`.

**Accuracy verdict:**
- Method A: ❌ "Guesses" — completely unaware of actual scale (283 methods, 104 dependents)
- Method B: ✅ — verified by actual file scan

---

### Q2 — "What is the blast radius of modifying UIStatusEffect?"

| | Method A | Method B |
|--|--|--|
| **Tool** | None | `analyze_impact_and_risk` |

**Method A answer:**
> "Modifying the buff UI will probably affect battle-related classes.  
> The exact scope requires manual code review."

**Method B answer (MCP):**
> Direct dependents: `CombatObjectPool`, `CombatManager`  
> Indirect: `UIGameField` → 7 BattleField subclasses, via `UITextComponent` → 200+ UI classes  
> Asset: `Assets/Resources/Prefabs/UI/ui_status.prefab` (1 reference)  
> Lint: No anti-patterns ✓

**Accuracy verdict:**
- Method A: ❌ "Battle-related classes" — completely misses 200+ UI classes
- Method B: ✅ — exact blast radius including prefab asset path

> 💡 Q2 has the highest token multiplier because UIStatusEffect → UITextComponent → all UI classes  
> produces a very wide reverse dependency tree (~12,800 tokens of tool output).

### Q3 — "Lyra project GAS structure — how many Abilities are there?"

| | Method A | Method B |
|--|--|--|
| **Tool** | None | `analyze_ue5_gas` |

**Method A answer:**
> "Lyra uses GAS extensively as an Epic sample.  
> LyraGameplayAbility is the base class and multiple Abilities should derive from it.  
> The exact count requires checking the source directly."

**Method B answer (MCP):**
> - Abilities: 1 (ELyraAbilityActivationPolicy — activation policy enum)
> - Effects: 0, AttributeSets: 1 (ULyraAttributeSet)
> - ASC-using classes: 7 (LyraCharacter, LyraGameState, ZombieCharacter, etc.)
> - GameplayTags: 13; confirmed custom ZombieCharacter GAS usage

**Accuracy verdict:**
- Method A: ❌ "Multiple Abilities" — actually only 1; Effects is 0 (near hallucination)
- Method B: ✅ — exact counts from 2-pass C++ header + uasset scan

---

### Q4 — "Which BehaviorTree does ZombieAIController use?"

| | Method A | Method B |
|--|--|--|
| **Tool** | None | `explore_class_semantics` + direct file check |

**Method A answer:**
> "It probably calls RunBehaviorTree() or has a BehaviorTree component.  
> Which BT asset it uses requires checking the source directly."

**Method B answer (MCP):**
> ZombieAIController.cpp: extends AAIController, only overrides OnPossess, body is empty.  
> No RunBehaviorTree() call found — BT connection is either in Blueprint or not implemented.  
> → **Conclusion: ZombieAIController does NOT use a BT in this project** (contrary to expectation)

**Accuracy verdict:**
- Method A: ❌ "Probably has RunBehaviorTree()" — actually absent. Wrong prediction.
- Method B: ✅ — confirmed "no BT" by reading actual source code

> 💡 This case highlights the ability to confirm *absence*.  
> Without MCP, the answer guesses "it probably exists"; with MCP, the code proves "it doesn't."

### Q5 — "Top 5 highest-coupling classes and circular dependency status"

| | Method A | Method B |
|--|--|--|
| **Tool** | None | `execute_gdep_cli` (scan) |

**Method A answer:**
> "Manager-type or common UI base classes are likely at the top.  
> CombatManager or GameManager are probably high."

**Method B answer (MCP):**
> Top 5 (in-degree):
> 1. UITextComponent — 231 (unexpected #1)
> 2. UIDynamicList — 66
> 3. Data_Entity — 54
> 4. EntityCard — 46
> 5. UIListGeneric — 43
>
> Circular dependencies: **40** (14 direct, 26 indirect)  
> Key patterns: CombatCore↔CombatInfo, EntityCard↔EntityCardPool

**Accuracy verdict:**
- Method A: ❌ Predicted "CombatManager" — actual #1 is UITextComponent (231); CombatManager isn't even in the top 5
- Method B: ✅ — actual figures; 40 circular deps correctly identified

---

## Accuracy Breakdown

| Item | Method A | Method B |
|------|----------|----------|
| Correct (5 questions) | 0 / 5 | 5 / 5 |
| Hallucinations | 3 (Q3 Ability count, Q4 BT existence, Q5 #1 class) | 0 |
| Incomplete answers | 5/5 (includes "check manually") | 0/5 |
| Verifiable | ❌ No | ✅ Code-backed |

## When is MCP Worth It?

```
Low token cost questions (≤10×):
  → Simple structure checks like Q4 ("does this exist?")
  → Looking up a specific class in a small project

High token cost questions (>30×):
  → Full structure + reverse dependency tree for large classes (Q1, Q2)
  → Full-project scans of production-scale codebases
  → But these questions can't be answered at all without MCP, making the comparison moot
```

**Practical guide:**
- "First-time codebase exploration" → MCP essential; token investment is worth it
- "Light confirmation of already-known structure" → Method A is fine
- "Pre-modification safety check" → MCP essential (Method A cannot make this judgment)
- **UE5 GAS flow analysis** → use `analyze_ue5_gas` + `blueprint_mapping` together
- **Full drill-down path interpretation** → use the LLM interpretation feature in the Web UI flow graph

## Appendix A: Bug Found During Testing

A **CLI crash on Windows Korean locale (cp949)** was discovered during testing.

**Symptom:** `UnicodeEncodeError` when printing `⚠`, `►`, `✓` emoji via CLI commands (`gdep scan`, `gdep lint`, etc.)

**Cause:** `click.secho()` tries to write UTF-8 emoji directly to a cp949 terminal

**Fix:** Introduced `_safe_echo()` wrapper — falls back to ASCII on encoding failure
```python
def _safe_echo(msg: str, **kwargs):
    try:
        click.secho(msg, **kwargs)
    except UnicodeEncodeError:
        safe = msg.encode(sys.stdout.encoding or 'ascii', errors='replace')
               .decode(sys.stdout.encoding or 'ascii')
        click.secho(safe, **kwargs)
```

**Scope:** Affects all direct CLI usage (MCP-routed calls are unaffected — MCP server handles encoding separately)

**Status:** ✅ Fixed (`gdep-cli/gdep/cli.py`)

## Appendix B: New Tools (step 27) — Usage Scenarios

### blueprint_mapping — C++ → Blueprint Implementation Link

```
Question: "Which Blueprint inherits from ARGameplayAbility_Dash?"
→ blueprint_mapping(project_path, "ARGameplayAbility_Dash")

Example output (HackAndSlash):
  ## Blueprint implementations of ARGameplayAbility_Dash (1 found)
  ### BP_GA_Dash_C (BP_GA_Dash_C)
    Path: /Game/Blueprints/GA/BP_GA_Dash
    K2 overrides: K2_ActivateAbility, K2_OnEndAbility
    Event K2_ActivateAbility -> PlayMontageAndWait -> ...
```

**Token efficiency**: Simple query to locate BP implementations → ~3-5× tokens (low cost, high value)

---

### analyze_ue5_gas + blueprint_mapping combo

```
# Step 1: Understand the full GAS structure
analyze_ue5_gas(project_path)
→ Abilities: 5 / AttributeSet: 1 / Tags: 169

# Step 2: Find BP implementations for each Ability
blueprint_mapping(project_path, "UARGamePlayAbility_BasicAttack")
→ BP_GA_BasicAttack, BP_GA_HeavyAttack + K2 overrides confirmed
```

**Benefit**: Traces not just to the C++ level but all the way to the actual Blueprint execution unit.  
Use the GAS tab in the Web UI to toggle between graph view and text view for the same data.
